    ● The second screen is a screen where the user will be asked to input a PDF file
        ○ The file will contain a table with multiple rows and columns
        ○ There will be a ‘submit’ button

    ● The third screen is a display screen
        ○ This screen should display the uploaded files list, the total number of rows, the time of
        upload, and user details.
        ○ The items should be clickable, and they should take to the last page, which will be the
        file details page.

    ● The last page will display the rows corresponding to the selected files and other detail.
        ○ Formatting is not that important
